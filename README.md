# Proxy Server

This is a Proxy Server for Node.js submitted as the [pre-work](http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_nodejs/prework) requirement for CodePath.

Time spent: 3-4 hoursCompleted:

* [x] Required: Requests to port `8000` are echoed back with the same HTTP headers and body
* [x] Required: Requests/reponses are proxied to/from the destination server
* [x] Required: The destination server is configurable via the `--host`, `--port`  or `--url` arguments
* [x] Required: The destination server is configurable via the `x-destination-url` header
* [x] Required: Client requests and respones are printed to stdout

## Features

### Echo Server:

```bash
$ curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000 -d "hello self" -H "x-asdf: yodawg"
* Rebuilt URL to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8000 (#0)
> POST / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:8000
> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
> Accept: */*
> x-asdf: yodawg
> Content-Length: 10
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
> 
* upload completely sent off: 10 out of 10 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< host: 127.0.0.1:8000
< user-agent: curl/7.43.0
< accept: */*
< x-asdf: yodawg
< content-length: 10
< content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
< Date: Mon, 03 Oct 2016 16:40:40 GMT
< Connection: keep-alive
< 
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
hello self
```

### Proxy Server:

Port 8001 will proxy to the echo server on port 8000.

```bash
$ curl -v http://127.0.0.1:8001/asdf -d "hello proxy"
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8001 (#0)
> POST /asdf HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:8001
> User-Agent: curl/7.43.0
> Accept: */*
> Content-Length: 11
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
> 
* upload completely sent off: 11 out of 11 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< host: 127.0.0.1:8001
< user-agent: curl/7.43.0
< accept: */*
< content-length: 11
< content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
< connection: close
< date: Mon, 03 Oct 2016 16:41:30 GMT
